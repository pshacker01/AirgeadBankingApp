# AirgeadBankingApp
Project 2 Submission
Summary of the Project:

The Airgead Banking App project aimed to solve the problem of helping users understand the growth of their investments over time, including the effects of compound interest. The app provided detailed reports showing year-end balances, earned interest, and other financial insights based on user inputs.
What I Did Well:

I particularly excelled in creating a clear and structured codebase that effectively handled user inputs and generated accurate financial reports. The logic for calculating compound interest was implemented efficiently.
Areas for Enhancement:

I could enhance the code by optimizing data storage and retrieval, reducing redundant calculations, and implementing better error handling. These improvements would make the code more efficient and secure, particularly in handling large datasets and ensuring robust user input validation.
Challenges and Solutions:

The most challenging part was implementing the dynamic calculation of year-end balances with compound interest. I overcame this by breaking down the problem into smaller components and testing each individually. Utilizing online forums and documentation as resources added significant value to my support network.
Transferable Skills:

The skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects include object-oriented programming, data handling, and the ability to structure complex algorithms efficiently. These skills are applicable in various fields, including software development and data analysis.
Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:

To ensure the program was maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I followed best practices such as using clear variable names, modularizing code into functions, and adding comments where necessary. This approach made the code easier to understand, modify, and extend in future projects.
